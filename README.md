### Idea 

![Project Image](/image/clean-architecture-diagram.png)

The project has simple idea that we will create a infrastructure manage with `service` folder and `repository` folder. The `service` folder will contain all the api call and the `repository` folder will contain all the business logic. The `bloc` folder will contain all the state management logic.

If my code is not follow these make it like this and make the code like this. 

Or follow any other Bloc and clean architecture pattern for flutter.
